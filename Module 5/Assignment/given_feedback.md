### This is the feedback given to a peer review for the activity of planning the DevOps adoption on his organization

Hi <name>!

It’s a pleasure to be able to contribute with your project.
I’ve already been involved with many startup environments and I’m happy to give you my viewpoint.
Below I’m sending a few suggestions to take a look at several steps of your journey, so they are things to keep in mind.

1. Software development is expensive. And here at MIT we’re learning the top-notch practices for that. Those kind of professionals will be expensive. So listen to the users (using UX practices such as benchmark, user interview, prototypes). This can save a lot of money avoiding the wrong requirements reaching your development pipeline.

2. Strategy for launch is great. And I’m telling this from a consultant standpoint. The discovery, design and MVP phases are essential for new businesses.

3. Have a strong arm on IT by your side. It seems to me you are the business man, and having somebody strong on IT with you will avoid wasting time and common-sense consultancies speeches. Investors invest on the jockey (C levels) and not on the horse (platform). So having good jockeys as you with you is a formula for success.

4. About the tools of your DevOps pipeline: it looks good. There is a trade-off in terms of time-to-market and Cloud vendor lock-in. The more cloud prebuilt tools you use, the faster you will be but the more locked in you will be as well. On one hand Hashicorp’s stack is a good suggestion if you want to avoid any lock-in, and on the other hand AWS tools like CloudFormation, Lambda and many others will speed up your development.

5. Software development: this is critical for your success. Don’t forget to take a look at agile practices like suggested in our course. Using Modern Agile is one way to guarantee you will have the best professionals with you.
